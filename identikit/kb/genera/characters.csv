Body,BodySize,Length in mm,"Size is often unhelpful at the genus level because there may be a considerable range among species within the genus, and even among individuals within a species.
But several genera (and the metallic sub-groups of (Lasioglossum and Halictus) are invariably small (<8mm). And some genera have no small species. E.g., Bombus is typically larger than a honeybee.",,key,numeric,spin,"3,20,1",10,1
